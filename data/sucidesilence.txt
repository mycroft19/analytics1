We are violence.
We are violence, at its finest.
Human violence at its finest.

We are the breed that grew with violence as a seed,
Growing stronger with our roots destructive feeding power.
Growing older and living as a slave,
Now we're vengeful and war is what we all crave.
And I know exactly what this is! More!
Human violence at its finest and I want more.
Human violence at its finest! More!
Human violence at its finest and I want more!

So this is what you do...
So take your precious time and pick your enemy,
Then you take the time to put them down on their knees.
Now take a second look into their worthless eyes,
Now pull the trigger back, click, surprise! Surprise!

We are the breed that grew with violence as a seed,
Growing stronger with our roots destructive feeding power.
Growing older and living as a slave,
Now we're vengeful and war is what we create.
And I know exactly what this is! More!
Human violence at its finest, and I want more.
Human violence at its finest! More!
Human violence at its finest and we want more!

Make sure you take the time... to put them down on their knees...
Make sure take the time and listen to them beg and plea
We are violence at its finest!

So take your precious time and pick your enemy,
Then you take the time to put them down on their knees.
Now take a second look into their worthless eyes,
Now pull the trigger back, click, surprise!
Now you are the victim of, my, my two hands!
Now you are the victim of more violent circumstance.

We are violence.

Now put them down on their knees,
Don't listen to all their begs and their pleas.
Put your finger on the trigger,
Now all you do is squeeze.
And peace the fuck out!
So put them down on their knees,
Don't listen to the begs and their pleas.
Put your finger on the trigger,
Now all you do is squeeze.

And now you're happy, as happy as can be,
You're so very happy with everything you see,
It all means nothing to me, human violence at its finest.
Fuck you, I want more
